			<div class="push_factor">
				<h1>Antisemitism</h1>
				<p>
					Many German Jews left due to antisemitism in Germany. 
					Antisemitism especially saw a massive increase when Hitler rised to power. 
					Hitler's anti-Jewish rhetoric turned the people against the Jews, 
					and Jewish people had to flee in order to not be persecuted.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pull_factor">
				<h1>Freedom of Religion</h1>
				<p>
					The right to practice any religion is protected under the U.S. Constitution. 
					German Jews find this useful because they would not be as discriminated for being Jewish as compared to in Germany. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="push_factor">
				<h1>German Revolutions of 1848</h1>
				<p>
					Political refugees flee from their homeland upon the failure of the revolutions. 
					The failure of the revolutions showed Germans that political reform in their home country would not be feasible for the foreseeable future.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pull_factor">
				<h1>Freedom of Speech</h1>
				<p>
					Freedom of Speech is protected under the U.S. Constitution. 
					Political refugees find this useful because they can voice their political beliefs without having to worry about persecution.
