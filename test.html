				<h1>Before the Move</h1>
				<p>
					Many German immigrants spent everything they had to go on board a ship to the United States.
					In the mid-1800s, this ticket usually costed around 50 German talers, the equivalent to 3 months salary.
					Families had to save for years to pay for an opportunity to cross the Atlantic.
				</p>

			<div>
				<h1>Travelling to America</h1>
				<p>
					German immigrants travelled roughly four to six months to reach the USA.
					Crossing the Atlantic Ocean was often the biggest hurdle in the effort to immigrate. 
					Often, ships did not provide adequate supplies for the journey such as food and drink. 
					Many people died in this naval journey, never getting to step foot in American soil.
