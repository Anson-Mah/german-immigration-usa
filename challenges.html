				<h1>Nativism</h1>
				<p>
					Mass immigration from Ireland and Germany sparked a fear that the current Anglo-Saxon Protestant 
					society of the United States would be taken over by the poor, uneducated, and Catholic immigrants. 
					A new political party, the American Party, or more commonly known as the Know-Nothings, was formed as part of a nativist movement in the 1800s. 
					This political party campaigned for longer naturalization periods, excluding immigrants from holding any public office, 
					and straight up turning away any future Roman Catholic immigrants.

				<h1>Anti-German Sentiment</h1>
				<p>
					The image associated with German identity quickly became negative upon the outbreak of the First World War. 
					Mass Anti-German hysteria arose, and German-Americans were pressured to discard their German identity, accelerating the loss of German culture in the United States.
					This Anti-German sentiment was further fueled by the Second World War, and German culture in America was nearly eradicated because of it.
