				As a part of the war effort, the British hired German mercenaries (Hessians) to fight against the Americans. 
				The British brung in around 30,000 Hessians to help them defeat the American rebels. 
				After the war ended, most Hessians simply returned to Germany. However, there were some who stayed.
				Around 5,000 Hessians stayed in America after the war, and settled in existing German communities.
