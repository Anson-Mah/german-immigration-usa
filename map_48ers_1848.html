				The Revolutions of 1848 had just resulted in a failure for the revolutionaries. 
				Political refugees fled Germany in order to not be persecuted. 
				The 48ers mostly settled in the Midwest, with notable destinations being Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Cincinnati. 
				These immigrants were inspired by letters from earlier German immigrants who had settled in the American Midwest. 
				The 48ers saw the U.S. as a place where equal rights were promoted and slavery being abolished (at least in the North).
